# Supply chain strategies and tradeoffs 
by Krishna Damarla

A company's ability to obtain products efficiently (sourcing/upstream) and distribute them effectively (sales/downstream) can be vital to its success. However, this process is with tradeoffs, and companies must carefully weigh various factors to make informed decisions that resonate throughout the entire supply chain (Phadnis, 2017).

Sourcing Strategies - Upstream

Sourcing, synonymous with purchasing or procurement, involves critical decisions like what to buy, evaluating total purchasing costs, selecting suppliers, creating supplier categories, deciding when to buy, managing supplier relationships, determining purchase quantities, and mitigating procurement risks (Stanton, 2023). Common steps for smart buying (sourcing) are:

1.	Look at what you bought before (Descriptive analysis on historical purchases).
2.	Think about what you'll need in the future (Demand forecasting / predictive analytics). 
3.	Check how well your suppliers did in the past (are they reliable, good quality, etc.).
4.	See if other suppliers could do better.
5.	Decide whether to make or buy the products (outsource vs insource)
6.	Figure out how important the products are and how easy it is to get them.
7.	Think about when you need to pay for things.
8.	Consider the risks involved.
9.	Improve and iterate based on above nine points

Tradeoffs of Sourcing Strategies

Companies face various tradeoffs when it comes to sourcing products. For example, deciding where to get materials from can be a tradeoff between cost and reliability. Opting for a cheaper supplier might save money, but it could come at the cost of lower quality or less reliable deliveries. The tradeoff here is between cost savings and maintaining a dependable supply chain.

Another tradeoff involves the quantity of products to purchase at one time. Buying in bulk may offer cost advantages, but it also ties up more capital and storage space. On the other hand, purchasing smaller quantities may be more flexible but could result in higher costs per unit. It's a balance between cost efficiency and flexibility.

Sales Strategies – Downstream

Once a company has the products, it needs to figure out how to sell them. Sales strategies should be adapted to what customers want and how products change over time. For example, customers might want more of something at certain times, like lunch during office hours or cinema tickets on weekends. Products also go through stages, from being new (product introduction) to popular (product growth / maturity) to not-so-popular (product decline) (Agarwal, 2017). Understanding these stages helps in deciding how to sell them.

A crucial factor in sales strategies is keeping track of products as they move across various transportation modes. To solve this challenge, companies utilize a blend of hardware and software solutions. Electronic logging devices (ELDs) on vehicles and trackers on shipments transmit real-time location data. This information integrates with visibility software, providing a holistic view of the product's journey and its environmental conditions. This dynamic duo not only answers the question of "Where are my products?" but also serves as an early warning system. If delays are expected, the hardware and software combo sends alerts, enabling proactive decision-making and ensuring a smooth journey from warehouse to customer (Stanton, 2023).

Tradeoffs of Sales Strategies

In the sales phase, companies also grapple with tradeoffs. For instance, selecting transportation modes involves a tradeoff between speed and cost. Faster modes like air shipping might be more expensive but ensure quicker deliveries, while slower modes like sea shipping are cost-effective but take longer. The tradeoff is between delivery speed and transportation costs.

Another example is inventory management. Keeping large inventories can prevent stockouts but ties up capital, while keeping minimal inventory reduces costs but increases the risk of stockouts. The tradeoff is between maintaining sufficient inventory levels and minimizing holding costs.

Integral End-to-End Supply Chain Strategy

The crucial aspect is to see these sourcing and sales strategies as interconnected components of an overall supply chain strategy. Decisions made upstream affect downstream processes and vice versa. For instance, if a company chooses cheaper but less reliable suppliers (sourcing tradeoff), it may face challenges in meeting customer demands (sales tradeoff). On the other hand, if it invests heavily in inventory to prevent stockouts (sales tradeoff), it might struggle with working capital (sourcing tradeoff).

An integral end-to-end supply chain strategy requires a delicate balancing act. Many companies utilize ERP (Enterprise resource planning) systems for minoring the processes transparency (The Capgemini Consulting Approach, 2018).  Companies also need to weigh the tradeoffs in sourcing and sales strategies to find an optimal solution that aligns with their overall business goals. It's not just about minimizing costs or maximizing sales; it's about finding the right balance that ensures efficiency, reliability, and profitability throughout the entire supply chain.

The above graph shows the U.S. electricity generation patterns by source, measured in million megawatt-hours (MWh) on Y-axis, over the years 1990 to 2023 on the X-axis, showcasing the stability of nuclear power generation over all these years. Nuclear energy source has maintained a stable production levels despite significant changes in other energy sources. Natural gas production has increased and became the main source of electricity in the U.S. Whereas, coal as energy source has declined in production over recent years. Renewable energy such as wind and solar have seen lot of growth, as the U.S. transitions to clean energy. This change in the energy landscape suggests a transition, where nuclear energy remains stable in electricity production over time (Sherwood News, 2024).

The line chart choice by the visual designer is good for showing trends in electricity generation and for comparing the growth or decline of various energy sources over time. Using different colors for each energy source makes it easier to track individual source trends. Highlighting the nuclear energy with red color clearly differentiates its stability over other source fluctuations. The graph visually summarized the broader shift towards clean energy as there is gradual increase in renewable energy source types and decrease in coal. This design is making the information more accessible and is helping viewers understand the overall trends in the U.S. energy sources, focusing on the role of nuclear energy in electricity generation.

# Benchmarking and Standard Operating Procedures 
by Krishna Damarla

Benchmarking is the practice of identifying and adopting the best methods in both process and product development and delivery (Wikipedia, n.d). In simpler terms, it involves moving from point A to point B by following industry best practices. Benchmarking is a vital part of organizational maintenance and is widely used as a management tool across various organizations, where products, services, and processes are measured against those of recognized industry leaders. There are nine distinct benchmarking standards, each serving specific purposes (Dembowski, 2013): 

- Internal Benchmarking: Compares within the organization.
- Competitive Benchmarking: Compares against industry competitors.
- Functional Benchmarking: Compares similar functions in different industries.
- Strategic Benchmarking: Focuses on long-term strategies.
- Performance Benchmarking: Evaluates performance metrics.
- Process Benchmarking: Analyzes specific processes.
- Financial Benchmarking: Compares financial metrics.
- Collaborative Benchmarking: Collaborates with other organizations.
- Best-in-Class Benchmarking: Compares against global top performers.

Examples of benchmarking organizations include the American Productivity & Quality Center (APQC), which conducts Open Standards Benchmarking (OSB) assessments, setting global standards for best practices and performance improvement (APQC, n.d). Another instance is the ISO 9001 group, which establishes criteria for quality management systems applicable to diverse industries such as construction management, IT services, automotive manufacturing, and healthcare (Combs, 2017).

Once the benchmarking objectives and measurements are defined, the focus is on understanding how the top performers achieved their status and determining the necessary steps to reach similar excellence (Dembowski, 2013). Such steps are also called Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). These procedures clearly define benchmarking goals, such as improved efficiency, enhanced quality, and cost reduction. SOPs specify key performance indicators (KPIs) or metrics to measure progress against defined objectives. These SOPs are step by step guide for establishing standards that guide employees based on organizational knowledge, promoting consistency and reliability, instead of the organization depending solely on the knowledge of individual workers (Combs, 2017)

SOPs are integral to the benchmarking process, ensuring a consistent and effective approach. SOP templates vary by industry; for instance, SOPs for ticket creation in IT service management involve processes like incident logging, escalation, and cancellation, often captured using ITSM tools like ServiceNow and SapphireIMS (Sapphire Systems, n.d). SOPs play a vital role in fostering a consistent approach across the organization, reducing variability, and enhancing operational reliability.

The synergy between benchmarking and SOPs is crucial in developing an effective Management Operating System (MOS) that supports operational excellence. While benchmarking sets external goals, SOPs provide internal guidelines and processes to achieve and sustain those objectives. Continuous feedback and improvement are essential to fostering a culture of excellence within the organization.

# Integrating Models for Enhanced Demand Planning and Forecasting 
by Krishna Damarla

Models and methods play a crucial role in providing accurate forecasts, offering valuable insights for effective management (Hanssens et al., 2005; Miller, 2015). These tools aid managers in comprehending consumer reactions to marketing activities, understanding competitors' positions, and identifying the determinants of sales, including promotions, pricing, advertising, and distribution, as well as their impact on capital market share (Hanssens et al., 2005).

Demand planning, a fundamental component of effective management, involves forecasting the demand for products or services to enhance production and delivery efficiency (Essex, n.d.). The primary objective of demand planning is to ensure an optimal inventory level to meet customer demand, preventing supply shortages or the unnecessary expense of producing and storing surplus inventory (Miller, T. W, 2015). 

Applied stochastic models, such as standardized models and generalizations, can significantly contribute to demand planning by enabling accurate marketing decisions tailored to specific situations or industry standards (Hanssens et al., 2005). However, recognizing the evolving role of consumer behaviors necessitates a broader focus on simplifying and implementing these models effectively in addressing business problems.

Demand forecasting, facilitated by market response models, estimates future demand. Demand planning involves the practical implementation of strategies to meet forecasted demand efficiently (Miller, T. W, 2015; Essex, n.d.). Demand planning is the process of transforming forecasted numbers into actionable plans, avoiding both overproduction and stockouts (Serating. L, 2016).

Expanding market response models to incorporate cross-functional, long-term impacts, and integration with other business functions, as well as considering investor response components, enhances the effectiveness of demand planning (Karaman, 2019). For instance, a sales forecasting model organized by specific time periods and locations can provide valuable insights for strategic decision-making, such as identifying optimal days or months for product promotions (Hanssens et al., 2005).

In conclusion, accurate demand planning is essential for efficient resource utilization and customer satisfaction. By leveraging advanced models and methods, organizations can navigate the complexities of consumer behavior and market dynamics, leading to informed and strategic decision-making.

# Why Business Analysts Are Essential to Your Operations Team 
by Krishna Damarla

Enhancing operational productivity within a team is a critical function of a business analyst, involving the formulation of pertinent questions crucial to the business or team. Prioritizing productivity over efficiency—emphasizing "doing more with the same" rather than "doing more with less"—can lead to greater benefits for companies (Mankins, 2017)

To effectively boost operational productivity through insightful questioning, business analysts must demonstrate their value by posing the right queries to the right individuals at the right time. This not only garners respect but also propels the operations team forward in adhering to project timelines and establishes management trust for making informed business decisions (Crosby, 2019). 

While engineers are inherently problem solvers, the most effective ones also embody the qualities of business analysts. Seeing the bigger picture or greater vision of the organization, as highlighted by Durham-Kilcullen, B. (n.d.), involves a combination of technical knowledge, industry insights, common sense, and reasoned actions.

Wearing various hats and engaging in role plays is sometimes necessary for business analysts to maximize business value (Crosby, 2019). For instance, acting as a scrum master to assign tasks from the backlog, reviewing requirements as a traditional business analyst, and assuming the role of a product owner to shape vision and guide teams toward timely project delivery.

In the digital era, where companies increasingly rely on data and analysis to outperform competitors, the role of a business analyst is pivotal. The specific requirements captured by a business analyst for building data and analytics solutions vary based on industry size and needs. For example, the requirements gathering and developing a data warehouse/business intelligence solution for a banking company is considerably more complex and security-stringent than for a manufacturing company (Bill Collins & Richard Keith, n.d.).

According to Cooke (2018, 2nd ed), business analysts following agile methodologies can contribute value to project teams in various ways, including identifying and confirming user stories, assessing business value and priority, exploring alternatives to meet business requirements, ensuring compliance with regulations, and refining existing business processes.

The landscape for traditional business analysts is evolving in the era of Generative AI dominance, where NLP ML models are trained to pose superior questions. Business analysts must now deliver more creative solutions to complex business problems than ever to earn the trust of their teams.
