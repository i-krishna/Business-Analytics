Authentication vs Authorization 

# Authentication:
Verifies identity (who you are).
Example: IAM authentication for MySQL/Postgres lets users log in to DB using AWS IAM credentials.

SQL Authentication using username/password is less secure than integrated authentication (AD/IAM). The use of shared accounts undermines the principle of least privilege, complicates auditing, and obscures accountability and responsibilityâ€”especially during disaster recovery or security incidents. The below model improves security without requiring a full AD integration.

AWS Secrets Manager is a cloud service that securely stores, manages, and rotates secrets such as database credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information.

For an app using RDS SQL Server:

You create a secret in Secrets Manager containing the SQL Server username and password for the dedicated app user.
The app retrieves these credentials programmatically (using AWS SDK or CLI) at runtime, instead of hardcoding them.
Secrets Manager can automatically rotate the credentials on a schedule, updating both the secret and the database user password. This improves security by centralizing secret management and reducing exposure of credentials in code or config files.


# Authorization:

Determines permissions (what you can do).
Example: IAM policies control who can manage RDS resources (create, modify, delete instances) via AWS Console/API.

SQL Server RBAC:  Create roles (CREATE ROLE), assign permissions (GRANT), add users to roles (ALTER ROLE ADD MEMBER)
```
CREATE ROLE ReportingUser;
GRANT SELECT ON Sales TO ReportingUser;
ALTER ROLE ReportingUser ADD MEMBER [krishna];
```
Power BI RBAC: Define roles in Power BI Desktop (Manage Roles), set DAX filters, publish to Power BI Service, assign users to roles for row-level security.

SQL Server on RDS: IAM is used for management/API (who can create/modify RDS instances), not for direct DB login.
