Case 1: Move from SQL Server (RDS/EC2) to AWS-native (Glue, S3, Redshift).
Sol: A modular, serverless data pipeline using AWS Glue, S3, and Redshift Spectrum. Use AI/LLM agents to auto-generate ETL code, monitor pipeline health, and optimize transformations.

```
[SQL Server] → [AWS Glue ETL] → [S3 Data Lake] → [Redshift DW]
       ↑           |                |                |
       |      AI/LLM Agent:   AI/LLM Agent:   AI/LLM Agent:
       |   Code Gen, Impact   Data Quality,   Query Tuning
       |   Analysis           Compliance      & Monitoring
```

Case 2: Legacy application performance monitoring (SolarWinds/Datadog) to cloud-native monitoring (AWS CloudWatch, Datadog). 
Sol: Integrate AWS CloudWatch with Datadog for unified metrics, logs, and alerts. 
Use LLMs to analyze performance data, auto-detect anomalies, and recommend query/index optimizations.
```
[App/DB] → [CloudWatch] → [Datadog] → [AI/LLM Agent]
       |         |             |         |
       |   Metrics/Logs   Unified View   Automated Insights
       |         |             |         |
       |   Alerting      Anomaly Detection & Recommendations
```

Case 3: Slow queries (need for query tuning and support) to AI-powered query analysis tools (SQL Sentry, custom LLM agent) 
Sol: Deploy AI-powered query analysis tools to auto-profile queries, suggest rewrites, and simulate impact.
Use LLMs to generate optimized SQL, index recommendations, and automate regression testing.
```
[User Query] → [AI/LLM Agent] → [Optimized Query] → [DB]
       |           |                |                |
       |   Profile, Rewrite   Index Suggestion   Test/Deploy
       |   Regression Test
```

Case 4: Measuring Impact on Goals (Metrics for system reliability and user success)
Sol: Implement dashboards tracking uptime, support requests, and success rates. Use LLMs to correlate system changes with outcomes, and recommend improvements.
```
[System Metrics] → [AI/LLM Agent] → [Impact Dashboard]
       |                |                |
       |   Correlation, Recommendations, Reporting
```
