# OLTP and OLAP Schema Diagram
#
# This diagram shows how normalized OLTP tables feed into denormalized OLAP tables via ETL.

# [Customer] <--- [Order] <--- [OrderItem] ---> [Product]   (OLTP)

# ETL Frequency: Daily, Hourly, or Real-time depending on business needs.

Typical setup:

For most business intelligence/reporting, ETL runs nightly (once per day).
For operational dashboards, ETL may run hourly or every few minutes.
For mission-critical, real-time analytics, ETL can run every few seconds (using streaming tools like Kafka, AWS Kinesis, etc.).
