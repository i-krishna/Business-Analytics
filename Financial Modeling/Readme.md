# Aspirations and Skill Development
by Krishna Damarla - Wednesday, January 8, 2025, 8:40 PM

Master’s in business analytics in the United States stems from my interest in learning about diverse cultures, understanding the business world in the United States and leveraging data to make business decisions. This program provides a unique combination of both technical and managerial skills, essential to interpreting complex data and manage people in the workplace.

During this course, I aim to gain proficiency in financial modeling and accounting. This involves creating structured representations of a company’s financial performance as outlined by Vipond (n.d.,). I also hope to learn how to build accurate, reliable models that support decision-making processes by adhering to best practices like periodicity, modularity, model transparency, and model drivers. Further, to understand the fundamentals of accounting, corporate taxation, cash flow, marking units, fixed and variable costs will complement financial modeling by ensuring accurate inputs and outputs. This knowledge is essential for interpreting financial statements and aligning models with organization’s objectives. Lastly, I am curious to explore behavioral economics and its relation to finance (Bigel, 2022).

In conclusion, this course is a steppingstone to a career in finance and audit industry, enabling us to acquire necessary skills with confidence and achieve technical excellence (Macabacus, 2024). I look forward to the opportunities it will unlock.
