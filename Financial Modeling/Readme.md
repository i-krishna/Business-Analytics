# Overcoming AI Implementation Challenges at Baker Tilly
by Krishna Damarla - Wednesday, January 29, 2025, 8:53 PM

Baker Tilly is a global financial and advisory firm that provides services in auditing, taxation, and consulting (Baker Tilly International, n.d.). The company is grappling with the difficult challenge of deploying advanced AI solutions across all departments. It recognizes the significant benefits of AI, such as operational efficiency, improved data analysis, and enhanced customer experience.

However, they face challenges with AI implementation in areas such as employees' resistance to adapting to new technology, the need for extensive training, data integration issues, and high costs. Further, ensuring that all employees are adequately trained to use these AI tools effectively is a daunting task. Integrating new AI systems with existing data and software adds another layer of complexity. Additionally, the high initial investment and ongoing maintenance costs that AI technology requires are also significant concerns (Baker Tilly US, n.d.).

A robust strategy is needed to address these concerns while adopting AI solutions company-wide. An organizational change management strategy to be adapted with a training team continuously communicating the benefits and importance of adopting AI solutions to employees through webinars and hands-on workshops. This will help them gain awareness and become familiar with new AI tools.  To solve the data integration issues, the ideal strategy would be to implement a phased integration approach starting with one department and gradually scaling to others. This will allow the company to identify and resolve issues early. A detailed cost-benefit analysis will ensure how AI investments will pay off in terms of improved performance and overall customer satisfaction.

By implementing this strategy, Baker Tilly can accelerate the transition to AI-powered processes and improve its operations and data integration pipeline. I created an influence chart as shown in Figure 1 to visually illustrate the problem and solution (Lucid Software, 2018).

# Optimizing Budget Allocation
by Krishna Damarla - Wednesday, February 12, 2025, 7:13 PM

One of the biggest challenges faced by technology consulting companies today, especially in the data services field, is optimizing budget allocations to data infrastructure while maintaining financial sustainability. This includes balancing operational costs, software and hardware licenses, cloud storage, and labor costs (Brigham & Houston, 2021). As customer demands increase, companies must strategically allocate budgets to key areas such as cloud computing costs (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, IBM), software subscriptions (BI tools, AI / ML platforms), and labor costs (data engineers and analysts). Effective cloud cost management is critical for companies relying on large-scale data analytics and infrastructure, as cloud spending can rapidly escalate without proper budgeting. 

To solve this problem, I designed a [financial budgeting model in Excel](/Financial%20Modeling/Financial_Budgeting_Model.xlsx) that integrates key budgeting components using a three-statement financial model (Schmidt, n.d.). The income statement estimates revenue from customer projects and calculates net income after deducting cloud computing expenses, software/hardware licenses, and employee salaries. The balance sheet tracks assets such as prepaid software expenses and liabilities (infrastructure costs). The cash flow statement evaluates how investment in cloud infrastructure affects liquidity and ensures financial stability (Damodaran, 2012). 

The model also includes detailed budgeting components to provide a comprehensive overview of financial planning (Principles of Accounting, n.d.). The sales budget forecasts revenue from customer contracts based on historical trends, while the production budget estimates data storage and processing needs for future projects. Direct materials and direct labor budget allocate funds for AI tools, data engineering teams, and infrastructure. The manufacturing overhead budget covers operational costs like IT support and security. The selling and administrative budget covers marketing and administrative overhead. The cash budget ensures liquidity to support ongoing operations and maintain financial flexibility.

The financial budgeting spreadsheet model presents the above discussed components in separate worksheets, providing a data-driven approach to managing cloud infrastructure costs. Leveraging financial modeling, leadership can make informed decisions about technology investments and workforce, avoiding unnecessary expenditures. Implementing this spreadsheet model can optimize budget allocation, ensuring financial sustainability while supporting the company's scalability in cloud-based services (Gartner, 2023).

# Apple’s Supply Chain Analysis
by Krishna Damarla - Wednesday, January 15, 2025, 7:42 PM

Apple's reliance on third-party delivery partners for shipping, repairs, and returns is causing inefficiencies, delays, customer dissatisfaction, and financial losses in its supply chain. For high revenue-generating products like MacBook and iPhone, this can result in losing valuable customers' trust and lead to costly replacements. This highlights gaps that jeopardize Apple's commitment to excellence and quality (SupplyChain247, 2023).

To solve this problem, I propose the attached Excel spreadsheet model divided into four vertically aligned sections (Corporate Finance Institute, 2018). The first section, Revenue Analysis, lists products and revenue data for 2022-2023, highlighting key growth drivers. The second section, Supply Chain Performance Analysis, identifies potential bottlenecks by evaluating delivery times, repair times, and customer complaints. The third section, Cost of Delays Analysis, covers the financial impact, including lost revenue & customers. The fourth section, Delivery Partners Analysis, recommends logistics partners, and delivery improvements.

The outcome of this approach is to evaluate key supply chain performance metrics for Apple's top revenue-generating products and to identify supply chain inefficiencies. Insights from this data-driven analysis guide strategic supply chain improvements, including advanced dynamic routing, predictive delivery algorithms, and improved collaboration with reliable logistics providers like DHL Express and FedEx. Further, integrating tracking technologies like AirTags, will increase accountability and mitigate risks for high-value products during transit. Implementing these strategies will improve customer satisfaction and efficiency, reduce costs, and strengthen Apple's logistics operations (Apple, n.d.).

# Aspirations and Skill Development
by Krishna Damarla - Wednesday, January 8, 2025, 8:40 PM

During this course, I aim to gain proficiency in financial modeling and accounting. This involves creating structured representations of a company’s financial performance as outlined by Vipond (n.d.,). I also hope to learn how to build accurate, reliable models that support decision-making processes by adhering to best practices like periodicity, modularity, model transparency, and model drivers. Further, to understand the fundamentals of accounting, corporate taxation, cash flow, marking units, fixed and variable costs will complement financial modeling by ensuring accurate inputs and outputs. This knowledge is essential for interpreting financial statements and aligning models with organization’s objectives. Lastly, I am curious to explore behavioral economics and its relation to finance (Bigel, 2022).

In conclusion, this course is a steppingstone to a career in finance and audit industry, enabling us to acquire necessary skills with confidence and achieve technical excellence (Macabacus, 2024). I look forward to the opportunities it will unlock.
