# Interest Rates & Their Impacts 
by Krishna Damarla - Wednesday, April 2, 2025, 5:18 PM

Interest rates are the price of borrowing or saving money. When I take a loan for a car, home, or business, the lender charges me extra money for using their funds. This additional cost is the interest. Similarly, the bank pays me interest if I save money in a bank account and let them use it (Higgins, 2023). For example, Simple Interest (SI) per year on a $10,000 car loan with a 5% annual interest rate for 5 years would be Loan Amount x Interest rate = $500. This means I pay $500 extra each year for borrowing the money (Banton, 2025). For 5 years, my simple interest would be Loan Amount x Interest rate x Time = $2500. In the real world, no bank lends money at simple interest. They give only at compound interest and the total interest paid for 5 years in this way is Principal×[(1+Interest rate)^Time-1)]) = $2762.81. Compound Interest per year is calculated as the Previous Year Balance × (1+Interest Rate). Below is an example of how compound interest works. 

Year 1: 10,000 + 500 = $10,500

Year 2: 10,500 + 525 = $11,025

Year 3: 11,025 + 551.25 = $11,576.25

Year 4: 11,576.25 + 578.81= $12,155.06

Year 5: 12,155.06 +  607.75 = $12,762.81

For businesses, high interest rates reduce profits if they apply for loans to run a business. Lower rates can encourage businesses to expand by hiring more staff. For individuals, higher interest rates make mortgages, and car loans more expensive to afford and higher interest rates on saving mean better returns but the value of money is subjected to inflation in future (Aasoka, 2019).

Several factors influence interest rates such as inflation, economic situation, and recessions. A country's central bank sets the rate. It’s interesting to note that countries which spend much on luxuries are not the ones with strong and stable economies. For example, some countries rely more heavily on public transport than individual cars and banks also use less or 0 interest rates for basic needs like education to balance the economy or to stabilize the gap between rich and poor. Setting correct interest rates both at the federal level and for public use can make a country’s economy grow stronger or weaker. Interest rates balance the economy, reward savers and penalize overspenders. They also influence job creation, housing markets, and everyday purchases (Killian, 2022).

# Optimizing Budget Allocation
by Krishna Damarla - Wednesday, February 12, 2025, 7:13 PM

One of the biggest challenges faced by technology consulting companies today, especially in the data services field, is optimizing budget allocations to data infrastructure while maintaining financial sustainability. This includes balancing operational costs, software and hardware licenses, cloud storage, and labor costs (Brigham & Houston, 2021). As customer demands increase, companies must strategically allocate budgets to key areas such as cloud computing costs (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, IBM), software subscriptions (BI tools, AI / ML platforms), and labor costs (data engineers and analysts). Effective cloud cost management is critical for companies relying on large-scale data analytics and infrastructure, as cloud spending can rapidly escalate without proper budgeting. 

To solve this problem, I designed a [financial budgeting model in Excel](/Financial%20Modeling/Financial_Budgeting_Model.xlsx) that integrates key budgeting components using a three-statement financial model (Schmidt, n.d.). The income statement estimates revenue from customer projects and calculates net income after deducting cloud computing expenses, software/hardware licenses, and employee salaries. The balance sheet tracks assets such as prepaid software expenses and liabilities (infrastructure costs). The cash flow statement evaluates how investment in cloud infrastructure affects liquidity and ensures financial stability (Damodaran, 2012). 

The model also includes detailed budgeting components to provide a comprehensive overview of financial planning (Principles of Accounting, n.d.). The sales budget forecasts revenue from customer contracts based on historical trends, while the production budget estimates data storage and processing needs for future projects. Direct materials and direct labor budget allocate funds for AI tools, data engineering teams, and infrastructure. The manufacturing overhead budget covers operational costs like IT support and security. The selling and administrative budget covers marketing and administrative overhead. The cash budget ensures liquidity to support ongoing operations and maintain financial flexibility.

The financial budgeting spreadsheet model presents the above discussed components in separate worksheets, providing a data-driven approach to managing cloud infrastructure costs. Leveraging financial modeling, leadership can make informed decisions about technology investments and workforce, avoiding unnecessary expenditures. Implementing this spreadsheet model can optimize budget allocation, ensuring financial sustainability while supporting the company's scalability in cloud-based services (Gartner, 2023).

# Overcoming AI Implementation Challenges at Baker Tilly
by Krishna Damarla - Wednesday, January 29, 2025, 8:53 PM

Baker Tilly is a global financial and advisory firm that provides services in auditing, taxation, and consulting (Baker Tilly International, n.d.). The company is grappling with the difficult challenge of deploying advanced AI solutions across all departments. It recognizes the significant benefits of AI, such as operational efficiency, improved data analysis, and enhanced customer experience.

However, they face challenges with AI implementation in areas such as employees' resistance to adapting to new technology, the need for extensive training, data integration issues, and high costs. Further, ensuring that all employees are adequately trained to use these AI tools effectively is a daunting task. Integrating new AI systems with existing data and software adds another layer of complexity. Additionally, the high initial investment and ongoing maintenance costs that AI technology requires are also significant concerns (Baker Tilly US, n.d.).

A robust strategy is needed to address these concerns while adopting AI solutions company-wide. An organizational change management strategy to be adapted with a training team continuously communicating the benefits and importance of adopting AI solutions to employees through webinars and hands-on workshops. This will help them gain awareness and become familiar with new AI tools.  To solve the data integration issues, the ideal strategy would be to implement a phased integration approach starting with one department and gradually scaling to others. This will allow the company to identify and resolve issues early. A detailed cost-benefit analysis will ensure how AI investments will pay off in terms of improved performance and overall customer satisfaction.

By implementing this strategy, Baker Tilly can accelerate the transition to AI-powered processes and improve its operations and data integration pipeline. I created an influence chart as shown in Figure 1 to visually illustrate the problem and solution (Lucid Software, 2018).

# Apple’s Supply Chain Analysis
by Krishna Damarla - Wednesday, January 15, 2025, 7:42 PM

Apple's reliance on third-party delivery partners for shipping, repairs, and returns is causing inefficiencies, delays, customer dissatisfaction, and financial losses in its supply chain. For high revenue-generating products like MacBook and iPhone, this can result in losing valuable customers' trust and lead to costly replacements. This highlights gaps that jeopardize Apple's commitment to excellence and quality (SupplyChain247, 2023).

To solve this problem, I propose the attached Excel spreadsheet model divided into four vertically aligned sections (Corporate Finance Institute, 2018). The first section, Revenue Analysis, lists products and revenue data for 2022-2023, highlighting key growth drivers. The second section, Supply Chain Performance Analysis, identifies potential bottlenecks by evaluating delivery times, repair times, and customer complaints. The third section, Cost of Delays Analysis, covers the financial impact, including lost revenue & customers. The fourth section, Delivery Partners Analysis, recommends logistics partners, and delivery improvements.

The outcome of this approach is to evaluate key supply chain performance metrics for Apple's top revenue-generating products and to identify supply chain inefficiencies. Insights from this data-driven analysis guide strategic supply chain improvements, including advanced dynamic routing, predictive delivery algorithms, and improved collaboration with reliable logistics providers like DHL Express and FedEx. Further, integrating tracking technologies like AirTags, will increase accountability and mitigate risks for high-value products during transit. Implementing these strategies will improve customer satisfaction and efficiency, reduce costs, and strengthen Apple's logistics operations (Apple, n.d.).

# Aspirations and Skill Development
by Krishna Damarla - Wednesday, January 8, 2025, 8:40 PM

During this course, I aim to gain proficiency in financial modeling and accounting. This involves creating structured representations of a company’s financial performance as outlined by Vipond (n.d.,). I also hope to learn how to build accurate, reliable models that support decision-making processes by adhering to best practices like periodicity, modularity, model transparency, and model drivers. Further, to understand the fundamentals of accounting, corporate taxation, cash flow, marking units, fixed and variable costs will complement financial modeling by ensuring accurate inputs and outputs. This knowledge is essential for interpreting financial statements and aligning models with organization’s objectives. Lastly, I am curious to explore behavioral economics and its relation to finance (Bigel, 2022).

In conclusion, this course is a steppingstone to a career in finance and audit industry, enabling us to acquire necessary skills with confidence and achieve technical excellence (Macabacus, 2024). I look forward to the opportunities it will unlock.
