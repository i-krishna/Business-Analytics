Personality Indicators and Psychometrics: 
These can be used to gain a better understanding of team membersâ€™ personalities 
and can even be used as a type of team building exercise. 
They can be used to encourage team members to improve interaction, build trust, 
and align their personalities with career progression. 
Some personality type categories include introverts, extroverts, pragmatists, innovators, and process-followers; 
however, they should not be used to judge anyone or make assumptions of anyone but should be an exercise to understand one better. 
Common types of personality assessment tools include:
- The Predictive Index (PI Behavioral Assessment Report)
- Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) 
- Big Five Personality Model (OCEAN: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism) 
- DISC (Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, Conscientiousness) 
- True Colors 
- TRACOM
