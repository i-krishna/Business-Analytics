Although this repository predominantly follows the APA (American Psychological Association) style of academic writing, I have a deep appreciation for the IEEE citation standard, which I used in my thesis. IEEE's efficiency and elegance, particularly its alphanumeric approach of representing papers using the first letters of the authors plus the publication year (e.g., [AMM+08]), resonates strongly with my engineering background.

It wasn't until today, during a webinar on academic writing and citation standards, that I truly appreciated how my engineering education shaped even these seemingly small choices. I trained at one of the world's leading engineering institutions, ranked 119th globally ([source](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2025/subject-ranking/engineering?page=4#!/length/25/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/scores)), where precision, efficiency, and clarity are core values instilled by exceptional faculty, researchers and fellow students.

This realization made me reflect on the various citation standards used across disciplines and countries. Below is a curated list of major citation styles:

```
IEEE - Unmatched in STEM fields
Chicago (Author-Date) - Most versatile across disciplines
APA 7th - Dominates social sciences, psychology, education
Harvard - International recognition, simple to use
Vancouver - Medical/biomedical gold standard

Engineering Schools (MIT, Caltech): IEEE
Business Schools (Wharton, Harvard Business): APA, Chicago
Medical Schools (Johns Hopkins, UCSF): Vancouver, AMA
Law Schools (Yale, Harvard): Bluebook exclusively
