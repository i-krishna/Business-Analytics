Although this repository predominantly follows the APA (American Psychological Association) style of academic writing, I have a deep appreciation for the IEEE citation standard, which I used in my thesis. IEEE's efficiency and elegance, particularly its alphanumeric approach of representing papers using the first letters of the first three authors plus the publication year (e.g., [AMM+08])—resonates strongly with my engineering background.

It wasn't until today, during a seminar on academic writing and citation standards, that I truly appreciated how my engineering education shaped even these seemingly small choices. I trained at one of the world's leading engineering institutions, ranked 119th globally ([source](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2025/subject-ranking/engineering?page=4#!/length/25/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/scores)), where precision, efficiency, and clarity are core values instilled by exceptional faculty.

This realization made me reflect on the various citation standards used across disciplines. Below is a curated list of major citation styles:

```
IEEE - Unmatched in STEM fields
Chicago (Author-Date) - Most versatile across disciplines
APA 7th - Dominates social sciences, psychology, education
Harvard - International recognition, simple to use
Vancouver - Medical/biomedical gold standard

Engineering Schools (MIT, Caltech): IEEE
Business Schools (Wharton, Harvard Business): APA, Chicago
Medical Schools (Johns Hopkins, UCSF): Vancouver, AMA
Law Schools (Yale, Harvard): Bluebook exclusively
```
