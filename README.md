# GenBI: Revolutionizing BI with GenAI, JS and Apple’s Design Principles
by Krishna Damarla - Wednesday, December 4, 2024, 10:18 PM

The Next disruptive BI (Less is More Dashboards) could be the one that embrace Apple's UI principles of simplicity, aesthetics, and intuitive UX outpacing legacy BI players like Power BI, Cognos, Tableau, QuickSight, Looker, etc.,

Apple’s unique design principles emphasize interactivity, readability, graphics and clarity (Apple Inc, n.d.), that traditional reporting tools often overlook. Many traditional tools lack the fine-tuned customization required to match Apple’s human interface design standards. Below is an example of a JavaScript-based visualization showing world’s historic events of last 400 years (1600 to 2000) with hover-over interaction (Stauber, n.d.). This visualization inspires me as it incorporates data readability with clarity and interactive graphics, enhancing user engagement and comprehension. A futuristic BI tool could merge JavaScript libraries like D3.js, Three.js 
and GenAI-powered capabilities such as [text-to-SQL](https://github.com/i-krishna/AI-Agents_LLMs/blob/main/text2SQL_Agent.py) query generation, automated report creation, and other advanced Agentic AI use cases outlined on page 23 of this [report](https://github.com/i-krishna/Business-Analytics/blob/main/Operations-Analytics/Instacart%E2%80%99s%20Operations%20in%20Grocery%20Delivery%20Innovation.pdf). When combined with Apple’s UI/UX design principles on [GenAI architecture](https://github.com/i-krishna/Business-Analytics/blob/main/Data-Science/Impetus%20GenAI%20Architecture.png) (Impetus, n.d.), such a platform could revolutionize data storytelling. By integrating holographic displays and other cutting-edge technologies (AR/VR) for an immersive experience beyond the screen, pushes the boundaries of dashboard and reporting visualization possibilities.

D3.js is a powerful JavaScript library for creating custom visualizations with interactivity using HTML, SVG, and CSS. Unlike traditional tools (Power BI or Tableau), D3.js is flexible and allows developers to bind data to DOM elements and create custom visualizations. This flexibility makes it ideal for creating interactive dashboards, animations, and dynamic charts (features that are often limited in pre-built visualization tools). However, D3.js has a steep learning curve due to its coding requirements, which can be difficult for beginners or non-programmers (Javinpaul, 2021). However, its strength lies in its ability to craft unique visuals, such as animated transitions and highly responsive user interfaces / user experience, suitable for advanced data storytelling and visual analytics. Three.js is another great library for 3D graphics for rendering detailed and immersive data visualizations that are not easily achievable with D3.js. Three.js can complement D3 by enabling 3D graphics and interactive spatial storytelling. It is ideal for use cases such as [ecological data](https://github.com/i-krishna/Business-Analytics/blob/main/Decision-Making/Readme.md#ice-usecase), geospatial analytics, immersive reporting, or scientific visualizations—scenarios where traditional chart libraries fall short.

# Spatial Data Science 
by Krishna Damarla, Spring Term 2 of 2024

The below map is a graphical representation of the London underground transport system (commonly known as the Tube). To explain it to a transportation manager with no technical background on spatial data analysis (Rey, et al., 2020), I will use the following points: 

1. Zone Information (Transport for London, 2024): The map divides London city into 9 zones (see numbers at top of the map: 1 to 9), helping travelers understand transportation costs and travel distances from point A to point B. For instance, price from Zone 1 to Zone 2 my cost less (say £5), while price may increase to £25 for travelling from Zone 1 to 9, as these zones are located at opposite ends.

2. Color-Coding: Each line on the map is represented by a unique color, making it easier for passengers to distinguish different lines. For example, the Bakerloo Line is brown, the Central Line is red, the Jubilee Line by silver, etc.,

3. Transfers: Stations wherein passengers can transfer between different lines are marked with white circles, highlighting them on the map for easy transfer from one line to another.

4. Landmarks: The map additionally consists of important landmarks, like stations with connections to other transportation modes, along with country wide rail offerings and airports (see entire list of symbols utilized at the bottom left of the map).

The 2D map of a city transportation attached below may seem complex at first. However with a background in data science and design, I aim to go beyond conventional mapping techniques. By integrating principles of spatial data analysis into interactive digital maps combined with computer graphics, AR (Augmented Reality), and parallel reality, I create personalized travel experiences for passengers selected routes. Major airlines (Delta Air Lines, 2022) already have such projects in place, enhancing their passengers journey experience as they travel from Gate A to Gate Z within airport area. Such projects can provide foundations for wider use in creating digital neighborhoods and entire digital cities (Anselin,  2020).

# The True Measures of Business Success
by  Krishna Damarla - Wednesday, November 20, 2024, 7:51 PM

The true measures of business success is to first clearly define the company’s goals, aligning all strategies with this purpose. Second, success depends on creating financial and non-financial drivers of value creation (Mauboussin, 2012). Product quality, customer loyalty, and satisfaction are non-financial factors that are just as significant as financial indicators such as sales and profits. Prioritizing sustainable practices, funding research and development, and attending to societal demands are a few more non-financial motivators.  

Social influence also increases customer loyalty, indicating that companies that prioritize values over profits will be more successful in the long run.  Businesses that align these non-financial factors with their objectives promote long-term growth and trust. Third, it is important to identify specific employee activities that support the company goals, establishing a connection between strategy and execution. Finally, companies must continually reevaluate their metrics and drivers to meet changing customer needs and market dynamics (Mauboussin, 2012).

For example, in the retail industry, metrics like Net Promoter Score (NPS) capture customer satisfaction, which directly impacts sales and long-term trust. Offering loyal customers benefits such as stock discounts shows how satisfaction leads to sustained growth. Similarly, in the banking sector, traditional drivers like teller turnover are being replaced by metrics such as digital platform efficiency and customer service quality, reflecting changing customer preferences. Innovation is essential for every business. Retailers using AI to forecast demand or banks creating digital customer interfaces increase customer satisfaction and competitiveness (Buckingham et al., 2023).
