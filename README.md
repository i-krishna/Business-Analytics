The true measures of business success is to first clearly define the companyâ€™s goals, aligning all strategies with this purpose. Second, success depends on creating financial and non-financial drivers of value creation (Mauboussin, 2012). Product quality, customer loyalty, and satisfaction are non-financial factors that are just as significant as financial indicators such as sales and profits. Prioritizing sustainable practices, funding research and development, and attending to societal demands are a few more non-financial motivators.  

Social influence also increases customer loyalty, indicating that companies that prioritize values over profits will be more successful in the long run.  Businesses that align these non-financial factors with their objectives promote long-term growth and trust. Third, it is important to identify specific employee activities that support the company goals, establishing a connection between strategy and execution. Finally, companies must continually reevaluate their metrics and drivers to meet changing customer needs and market dynamics (Mauboussin, 2012).

For example, in the retail industry, metrics like Net Promoter Score (NPS) capture customer satisfaction, which directly impacts sales and long-term trust. Offering loyal customers benefits such as stock discounts shows how satisfaction leads to sustained growth. Similarly, in the banking sector, traditional drivers like teller turnover are being replaced by metrics such as digital platform efficiency and customer service quality, reflecting changing customer preferences. Innovation is essential for every business. Retailers using AI to forecast demand or banks creating digital customer interfaces increase customer satisfaction and competitiveness (Buckingham et al., 2023).
