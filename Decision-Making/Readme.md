# Insurance Analytics Experience by Krishna Damarla

Project Experience

In a project with an insurance client, I extracted data into a central data warehouse table for advanced analytics. At first, I worked with senior business analysts to understand the key business challenges and identified key performance indicators (KPIs) that directly affect enterprise operations. Later, I focused on cleansing, data modelling, and leveraging statistical, machine-learning models for descriptive and predictive analysis (Ariansen & Madecraft, 2022). This project culminated in recommending data-driven solutions to client to enhance their decision-making in business operations and marketplace positioning.

Tools Usage

In this project, I compared various business intelligence (BI) tools from major cloud vendors. I identified the pros and cons of these tools with a focus on client-specific reporting needs. This includes depth of analysis, chart selection, colour combinations, and data masking (security) for specific users. Although some BI tools offer customization, many fail, even with enterprise licenses. I decided upon Cognos due to its ease of on-premises integration, superior customization capabilities, data modelling options, and connectors for external data sources (Hiter, 2023).

Future Outlook

I am interested in learning about various techniques in integrating generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into reporting and dashboard creation (Raghupathi & Raghupathi, 2021). For instance, enabling users to create reports with natural language commands like, "Create an interactive bar chart from recent sales data," which would then be converted into an SQL/NoSQL query. Such a query verified by developers would then pull information from the database, generate a creative report, and present it to the user for visual analysis. This type of innovation is cost-effective for non-technical clients, allowing them to save valuable time while enhancing their decision-making capabilities.

Code to Implement above Suggestion: [face-recognition.py](../Data-Science/Python/face-recognition.py)

Note: The above code snippet is intended for scenarios where a person's face has already been trained using a predefined set of images in a training model. In real-world applications, recognizing the face of an unknown individual requires using a government-approved ID and photograph to train the model, enabling it to match the person in live video for recognition purposes. Implementing such an architecture must align with healthcare security practices and regulations of local body, such as HIPAA in the U.S, PIPEDA in Canada, GDPR in Europe, DISHA in India, and PIPL in China.
