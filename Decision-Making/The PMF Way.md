Part 1: Fellows Behavioral Assessment Tool (FBAT)
90 Questions - 30 min

Part 2: Fellows Situational Assessment Tool (FSAT)
12 scenarios - 60 min
Carefully read through each scenario and associated response options. Once you have carefully read through the scenario and response options, rate the effectiveness of each response option according to the 5-point scale listed below. Again, you will provide an effectiveness rating for every response option associated with a given scenario.

Scenario 1 of 12: You are helping a team draft a new policy. The team includes technical experts from your division and legal experts from another division. Involving these two groups helps ensure the policy is technically sound and legally defensible. However, the groups have started to provide conflicting recommendations during meetings, and tensions are rising. You have worked on similar projects in the past, and disputes between your technical and legal experts have interrupted project progress. You are worried that if a major dispute happens between the experts, then the project may derail and cause the policy to be drafted in a way that limits impact.

Please rate the effectiveness of each response option below for this scenario.
Response Option	Very Ineffective	Somewhat Ineffective	Neutral	Somewhat Effective	Very Effective
1.1	Address the tension in the next meeting by discussing the issue and collectively developing collaboration expectations.					
1.2	Select one technical expert and one legal expert that have communicated better than others to speak for each group during meetings.					
1.3	Ask your supervisor if you can replace the experts who have been most vocal about their opposing views.					
1.4	Host a meeting with each group of experts separately to discuss the importance of working together on the project.					
1.5	Clarify that their role as experts is to advise, and you will reconcile any differences.					
1.6	Suggest that the group come to full consensus for all decisions to ensure that each expert supports the decisions.					
1.7	Get each group to identify the key issues with the policy so that you can draft a document that considers all input.
