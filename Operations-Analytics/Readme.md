Why Business Analysts Are Essential to Your Operations Team by Krishna Damarla 

Enhancing operational productivity within a team is a critical function of a business analyst, involving the formulation of pertinent questions crucial to the business or team. Prioritizing productivity over efficiency—emphasizing "doing more with the same" rather than "doing more with less"—can lead to greater benefits for companies (Mankins, 2017)

To effectively boost operational productivity through insightful questioning, business analysts must demonstrate their value by posing the right queries to the right individuals at the right time. This not only garners respect but also propels the operations team forward in adhering to project timelines and establishes management trust for making informed business decisions (Crosby, 2019). 

While engineers are inherently problem solvers, the most effective ones also embody the qualities of business analysts. Seeing the bigger picture or greater vision of the organization, as highlighted by Durham-Kilcullen, B. (n.d.), involves a combination of technical knowledge, industry insights, common sense, and reasoned actions.

Wearing various hats and engaging in role plays is sometimes necessary for business analysts to maximize business value (Crosby, 2019). For instance, acting as a scrum master to assign tasks from the backlog, reviewing requirements as a traditional business analyst, and assuming the role of a product owner to shape vision and guide teams toward timely project delivery.

In the digital era, where companies increasingly rely on data and analysis to outperform competitors, the role of a business analyst is pivotal. The specific requirements captured by a business analyst for building data and analytics solutions vary based on industry size and needs. For example, the requirements gathering and developing a data warehouse/business intelligence solution for a banking company is considerably more complex and security-stringent than for a manufacturing company (Bill Collins & Richard Keith, n.d.).

According to Cooke (2018, 2nd ed), business analysts following agile methodologies can contribute value to project teams in various ways, including identifying and confirming user stories, assessing business value and priority, exploring alternatives to meet business requirements, ensuring compliance with regulations, and refining existing business processes.

The landscape for traditional business analysts is evolving in the era of Generative AI dominance, where NLP ML models are trained to pose superior questions. Business analysts must now deliver more creative solutions to complex business problems than ever to earn the trust of their teams.
